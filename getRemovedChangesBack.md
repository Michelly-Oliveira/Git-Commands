#### If you want to recover some changes that have been deleted

1. get the hash of the commit
1. 'enter' the commit, at this point we have those changes
1. store those changes on a branch

---

1. `git reflog`
1. `git checkout <hash>`
1. `git branch <name>`

- `git reflog`: shows commits in the order you last referenced them
